		<h1>Run your own Eltisa Server</h1>

		This page explains how you can set up you own public Eltisa Server. It is not that easy but it is possible :-)
		Eltisa is a block game similar to the construction mode of minecraft. It is freeware and still under development.<br>
		WARNING: You must not install it in any security relevant environment. It runs a webserver which has not passed a security audit.<br>		

		<h3>Prerequisits</h3>
		- A windows server connected to the internet<br>
		- An installed .net 6 runtime system. You can get this from microsoft<br>
		- A security certificate that is installed in the store 'My' on 'localmachine'. You can get one for example from https://letsencrypt.org/ <br>
		- The latest chrome or firefox browser<br>
		
		<h3>Download</h3>
		Download the zip archive from here: <a href="https://eltisa.ch/html/eltisa025.zip">eltisa.zip</a><br>
		Extract the archive in the directory of your choice, for example in C:\programs<br>

		<h3>Configure</h3>
		Open the file C:\programs\eltisa\rundata\citizen.xml and configure some users according to your needs.<br> 
		WARNING: Since passwords are stored unencripted do not use any passwords that are used somewhere else!
		Open the file C:\programs\eltisa\rundata\config.xml and change the property 'CertificateName' to the name of your certificate.
		If you change the property 'Mode' from 'Server' to 'Home' then everybody can modify your world and you don't need to configure any users. Otherwise
		only users can add and remove blocks and visitors can only watch.

		<h3>Run</h3>
		Open a console in administrator mode and switch to C:\programs\eltisa\release<br>
		Execute the comand: 'dotnet eltisa.dll'<br>
		Your eltisa server is now running and you and your friends can connect via browser by entering the url of your server.<br>
		If you want to stop the server, do it with Control-C. Do not just close the shell window. Otherwise changed data might not be stored or even get corrupted.

		<h3>Import</h3>
		You can import your own world from minecraft. But don't do this while the eltisa server is running!<br>
		The eltisa world is stored in C:\programs\eltisa\regions. If you delete the files in that directory you are left with the plain ocean. 
		Then in the directory C:\programs\eltisa\import you find some examples how you can import minecraft *.mca files.

		<h3>Create</h3>
		So far there is no dotnet api dll to create a world via programming language. If you are interested in such an api, let me know.
